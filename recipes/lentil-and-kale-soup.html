    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe by <a href="http://annajones.co.uk/recipe/lemony-lentil-crispy-kale-soup">Anna Jones</a>, this is sort of a cross between a dhal and a soup. It is light but flavourful and is pretty quick and easy too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a splash of olive or rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 leek, washed, trimmed and finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black mustard seeds</li>
        <li>juice of 2-3 lemons</li>
        <li>250g split red lentils</li>
        <li>1 veg stock cube, or 1 tablespoon veg stock powder</li>
        <li>4 handfuls of kale (or other greens), washed, trimmed and shredded</li>
        <li>yoghurt (to serve - optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a large pan on the heat. Add a little oil and turn the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Add the leek and fry for a few minutes, until it has softened and smells sweet.</li>
        <li>Add the spices and fry for another couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Squeeze in the juice of 1 lemon and stir around to lift all the spices from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the lentils, 1.5 litres of water and the stock cube or powder and allow to bubble away for 20-35 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and the soup has thickened.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and, if you like, you can blitz the whole lot to a thin dhal consistency, then squeeze in the juice of the remaining 2 lemons, tasting as you go to make sure it doesn't get too lemony. It may seem like a lot, but you really want the lemony tang to come through.</li>
        <li>Just before you're ready to serve, saute the kale in a little olive oil until it slightly softens but begins to crisp at the edges.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls and top with the salted yoghurt and the crispy kale.</li>
    </ol>
